Hi and welcome to my website! I am currently a sophomore at the University of Kansas studying computer science and mathematics. I love studying computer science and math to figure out how the weather works. This interest started when my family and I came back from a Thanksgiving trip, and there was a blizzard warning in Kansas City. I was fascinated by the swirling snow and the strong winds. In college at the University of Kansas, I realized that weather and computer science are connected. This made me choose to study programming and math. The mix of these subjects is not just interesting but also has the potential to change how we understand weather.
