Hiya! 

Welcome to my website! I am currently a third-year at the University of Kansas studying computer science, mathematics, and design. 

Outside of class, I am involved with The Spencer Museum of Art and TEDxKU. 

Check out the projects tab to see what I have been working on recently! 

Check out the hobbies tab to see more to see what else I enjoy doing outside of academics.
