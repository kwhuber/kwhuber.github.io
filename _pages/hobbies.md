Coffee
-------
* I am also a barista! Whenever I get a free weekend, I try and pick up a shift at a local coffee shop where I grew up. 
* I even maintain an instagram ðŸ˜„ You can check out some of my latest lattes at [its_coffeeyo](https://www.instagram.com/its_coffeeyo/)
* Below is one of my favorite lattes: honey + cinnamon ðŸ˜‹

Soccer
-------
* I played soccer all throughout highschool and have continued to watch it on TV. I am a HUUUUUUGE Lliverpool FC supporter and do not miss a game. 
* My favorite is Thiago Alcantara but he is veeeery injury prone ðŸ™ƒ but I suppose that makes me cherish the moment when he steps onto the field even more lol
* Click on the image below to witness a Liverpool masterclass ðŸ¤©
